# Assignment1
This project is a UI for a spaceship.
The blow picture is star screen. On the left upper corner is the time and hours. On the bottom there are two balls, balls will move up and move down. User can watch space and stars on the bottom before activate system. The rend button is use to activate system. 
Start screen:

When user pressed activate button. The ship control panel will display. On the top, the middle is compass for the spaceship. Right side is the fan and left side is time. On the bottom middle is the steering ball, user can change spaceship direction, left side two bar is spaceship O2 and CO2 detail. Right side is the Fuel, speed and radar detail. Shield button is user to open shield for spaceship. Yellow cycle is planets; User click them will display information about that planet on the left side blackboard. 
User can press “a” and” d” to change spaceship forward direction and press “w” and “s” to change speed for the spaceship.  The steering ball rotate speed is depending by spaceship speed. The spaceship speed is max, the steering ball rotate speed also max. if fuel and O2 not enough will display warning.  And speed will be 0; This all program functions.

# Code Challange
one challange is to draw stars. I need a lots of stars, if I draw each star need a lots of time. So I use the arraylist to drawstar, just a few line draw one thousand stars.
Second challage is how to implement space shield. I use sphere function to draw a very large ball and put the spaceship in the ball.
